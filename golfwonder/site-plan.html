Why is it that sometimes when you go into a golf store anxiety can set in. Why is it that when you look up golf clubs for sale thousands come up. Some of the age old questions when it comes to golf is “what club do I get”, “What club will help me hit the farthest” and, ”What club will help me hit the straightest”.

      <h3>Drivers</h3>
      <p>
        [When people first look at golf, a lot of times they look at the big hits and the distances that those hits can go. It is always satisfying watching professionals hit a small white ball over 300 yards. That is why the Driver might be the hardest club to pick out. We all want to be able to hit it that far  and so  the questions becomes what will be the driver to help us do that. From all the new technologies in them to the two to four different versions of drivers released each year by different companies, it can be hard to find the right one. Recently I spent over three weeks trying to find a new one. I wasnt sure picking out a driver could take so long. I wasnt aware of all the different articles from every single brand claiming to be the best as well of all the different things you have to think about to choose a new driver. After those three weeks plus a hour in a store trying out different drivers, I finally found the one for me. I dont want you to have to go through that. Our goal is to get you out on the course as quick as possible with some new hardware in your hands. Here are some of the best drivers around for all different price ranges.

      <h3>Putters</h3>
      <p>
        Some say the short game is the most boring part of golf while others say it is the most important part. One thing is for certain though, the putter is the club you will be hitting with the most. As golfers we tend to forget that and try to put money into everything else besides the putter.  The putter though needs to be reliable and needs to fill good. Once you get it near the hole the object of the game is to put it in the hole. That is why picking a putter is so important. It can really make it or break it when trying to become a scratch golfer. This is a club that also has thousands of options from the mallet putters to the blade putters and a couple of others along the way it's hard to find the right one. Below are a couple of options of the top rated mallet putters and blade putters.

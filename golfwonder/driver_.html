        <h2>Selecting a Driver</h2>
        <p>When people first look at golf, a lot of times they look at the big hits and the distances that those hits can go. It is always satisfying watching professionals hit a small white ball over 300 yards. That is why the Driver might be the hardest club to pick out. We all want to be able to hit it that far  and so  the questions becomes what will be the driver to help us do that. From all the new technologies in them to the two to four different versions of drivers released each year by different companies, it can be hard to find the right one. Recently I spent over three weeks trying to find a new one. I wasn’t sure picking out a driver could take so long. I wasn’t aware of all the different articles from every single brand claiming to be the best as well of all the different things you have to think about to choose a new driver. After those three weeks plus a hour in a store trying out different drivers, I finally found the one for me. I don’t wan’t you to have to go through that. Our goal is to get you out on the course as quick as possible with some new hardware in your hands. Here are some of the best drivers around for all different price ranges.</p>

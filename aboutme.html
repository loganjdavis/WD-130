        <h2> I don't have a Nick-name sadly</h2>
        <p> My name is Logan Davis. I am currently in the Applied Technology Major. I am married to my best friend and we have been married for almost 2 years now.</p>
        <p> I love anything to do with sports but my favorites are Golf and Basketball. I currently work for a company call Arion Care in their HR department as an Employment Advisor. I served a mission in Monterrey Mexico and have been a memeber my whole life.</p>
